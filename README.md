OutboundGPT is a standalone AI assistant designed to accelerate outbound marketing campaign creation.

It acts as a digital marketing copywriter, generating high-quality, structured, and persuasive content based on the campaign theme and product URLs provided by the user.

Marketing teams—especially in regulated industries—often face bottlenecks when creating campaign content from scratch. 

**OutboundGPT helps solve this by:**
Generating structured copy using proven frameworks (e.g. AIDA)
Extracting and synthesizing product benefits from live URLs
Producing multilingual, tone-compliant content
Automating repetitive writing tasks with consistent quality

**Key Features**
Up to 18 product URLs accepted and analyzed
Extracts benefits from each product page
Generates a benefit summary across all products
Writes an AIDA-style introduction based on extracted insights
Supports file upload, image preview, and conversational memory
Clean and responsive chat UI
Right-side panel for input (campaign theme + product URLs)
Regenerate and reset buttons for quick iteration

**How It Works**	
1.	Fill in the campaign theme and product URLs via the sidebar
2.	Click “Generate” to send your input to the backend
3.	OutboundGPT: Visits each URL, extracts product benefits, synthesizes key takeaways and writes a compelling, structured intro based on the AIDA copywriting framework.
4.	Review, refresh, or reset content as needed
